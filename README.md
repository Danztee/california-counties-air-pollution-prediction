# Prerequisite
- Install Python 3.9 if you do not have it already
- Install pip if you do not have it already
- Create a python virtual env with `python3.9 -m venv env`
- On Windows CMD, use 'env\Scripts\activate' to start a virtual python environment session. This assumes you have a virtual environment named env. If you haven't created it yet, you can create one by running 'python -m venv env'.
	Note: For Mac, run `source env/bin/activate` from the terminal.
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies
